## üìú About The Project

This project is the initial web-based prototype for the **"Nagrik Aur Samvidhan"** (Citizen & Constitution) initiative, developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024. Our objective was to create an innovative digital solution to spread constitutional literacy among Indian citizens in an engaging, gamified format. This prototype focuses on simplifying key concepts from the Constitution, including the Preamble, Fundamental Rights, and Directive Principles.

This repository contains the complete, functional web version that served as the foundational proof-of-concept for our successful SIH entry.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Story-Driven Narrative:** Engages users with a compelling story of a boy who travels back in time to learn the importance of constitutional rights.
* **Interactive Mini-Games:** Two distinct levels designed to teach specific constitutional articles through simple, intuitive gameplay.
* **Visual Metaphors:** Complex legal concepts like "Equality Before Law" are represented through visual puzzles (e.g., repairing a bridge, balancing a scale).
* **Built with Vanilla Stack:** Developed purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure maximum accessibility and demonstrate core web development skills.

## üéÆ Gameplay Concept & Learning

The story follows a modern-day boy who disregards constitutional principles. A magical event sends him to the past, where he must solve problems by applying these very principles.

* **Level 1: The Bridge of Equality**
    * **Gameplay:** The player uses arrow keys to align logs of a broken bridge. The logs depict people from different strata of society (judges, politicians, students, women). To fix the bridge, all logs must be brought to the same level.
    * **Learning Outcome:** This visually teaches the principle of **Article 14: Equality Before Law**, demonstrating that all citizens are equal.

* **Level 2: The Scales of Justice**
    * **Gameplay:** Faced with discrimination, the player must balance a set of scales. One side has the powerful, the other has the marginalized. The player must add positive items (books, pens, symbols of equality) to balance the scales instead of negative items (guns, knives).
    * **Learning Outcome:** This interaction explains the **Prohibition of Discrimination**, also rooted in Article 14.

## üöÄ The SIH Journey & Outcome

This web prototype was the foundation of our pitch for the Smart India Hackathon. The core concepts and game mechanics developed here were later refined and rebuilt in Unity for the final round of the competition.

Our team's innovative approach was highly recognized, and we were successfully selected as a **National Finalist**, placing us among the top teams in the country for our solution.
